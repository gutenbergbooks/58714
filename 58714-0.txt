  His shirt was made of a butterfly’s wing,
  His boots were made of a mouse’s skin,

  And a mouse for a horse he used to ride.

NEW HISTORY

OF THE

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

TOM THUMB.

[Illustration]


When I was a little boy, children’s books were not quite as plenty, or
as cheap, or as _good_ as they are now. In those days, children did not
often have a present of a pretty book with beautiful pictures; but when
they did get one, it was highly prized.

We had Cock Robin, and Jack the Giant Killer, and Blue Beard, and The
Forty Thieves, and many other _amusing_ but not very _instructive_
tales. Tom Thumb was one of the number, and was a favorite book of
mine, although I knew the story was not true, and that there were no
such beings as magicians and fairies. Perhaps my little readers would
like to know what kind of stories we old folks read when we were such
little bodies as you are now. I think I remember enough of Tom Thumb
to be able to tell you the story.

[Illustration: MERLIN AND THE FAIRY QUEEN.]

Once on a time, Merlin, a famous magician, was traveling, and being
weary, he stopped at a plowman’s cottage to ask for some refreshment.
The plowman’s wife kindly brought him a bowl of milk, and a wooden
plate of good brown bread, which she urged him to partake of.

Merlin could not help seeing, that the honest couple looked quite sad
and sorrowful; so he asked the cause, and learned that they had no
children; the wife declaring, with tears in her eyes, that she should
be happy if she had a son, even if he were no bigger than his father’s
thumb!

Merlin was much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man’s
thumb, and sending for the queen of the fairies, he told her of the
desire of the plowman’s wife. The queen was no less pleased than
Merlin, and she said the wish should be granted. Accordingly, the
plowman’s wife had a son, who was just the size of his father’s thumb,
and was named by the queen, TOM THUMB.

[Illustration: THE PEDLER AND THE PUDDING.]

One day his mother was making a pudding, and that he might see how it
was made, Tom climbed on the top of the bowl; but his foot happening
to slip, he fell over head and ears into it, and his mother not seeing
him, she stirred him into the batter, and then popped the whole into
the pot.

The hot water made Tom kick and struggle, and his mother, seeing the
pudding jump up and down in the pot, thought it was bewitched. A pedlar
going by at that moment, she gave him the pudding, which he put in his
pack and then walked on. As soon as Tom could get the batter out of his
mouth, he began to cry out. This so frightened the pedler that he flung
the pudding over a fence, and took to his heels. The pudding was broken
by the fall, and poor Tom crawled out and ran home.

[Illustration: TOM LANDS IN THE HOT SOUP.]

Tom never was any bigger; but as he grew older he grew cunning and sly.
When he played with boys for cherry-stones, and had lost his own, he
used to creep into his playmates’ bags, fill his pockets, and come out
to play again. One day, as he was doing this, the owner chanced to see
him. “Ah, ha, my little Tom,” said he, “I have caught you at last; now
I will punish you for stealing.” So he drew the bag-string tight about
his neck, and then shaking the bag, Tom’s legs and thighs were so sadly
bruised, that he was thrown into a raging fever.

Just at this time the queen of the fairies came in a coach drawn by
six flying mice, and placing Tom by her side, drove through the air to
her palace in fairy land, where she kept him till he was restored to
health. Then, taking advantage of a fair wind, she blew him straight
to the court of king Arthur. But just as Tom was about to land in the
palace-yard, the king’s cook happened to pass with a huge bowl of
soup, into which Tom fell plump, and splashed the hot soup all in the
cook’s face and eyes.

[Illustration: TOM SWALLOWED BY A FISH.]

“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Tom, half scalded and half drowned in his
hot bath; “murder! murder! murder!” bellowed the cook, who was a cross,
red-faced old fellow, and supposed Tom had done all this mischief
on purpose. Determined to be revenged on the little fellow for the
imaginary insult, he urged his brother, who was a miller, and as cross
and cruel as himself, to take little Tom home with him, and put him
where he could do no more mischief.

Accordingly, the miller pocketed Tom, and carrying him to his mill,
dropped him from a window into the river. But Tom was not born to be
drowned. A large salmon swimming by at that moment, caught him in its
mouth and swallowed him without any trouble.

[Illustration: TOM RELEASED.]

The salmon was soon caught, and being a fine large fish, was
presented to the king, who ordered it to be dressed immediately.
When it was cut open, every body was delighted to see little Tom Thumb
step out. He soon became the favorite of the king, who knighted him,
and gave him a little golden palace to live in, and also a tiny coach,
which was drawn by six white mice.

King Arthur one day questioned Tom about his parents, and Tom informed
his majesty that they were worthy people, but very poor. Then the
king led him into his treasury, and showing him the piles of gold and
silver, told him he might pay his parents a visit, and take with him as
much money as he could carry! Accordingly, Tom procured a little purse,
and putting a sixpence into it, he with much labor and difficulty got
the purse upon his back and started for home.

His mother met him at the door, where he arrived almost tired to death,
having traveled nearly half a mile, with a huge sixpence on his back.
His parents were delighted to see him, especially as he brought such an
amazing sum of money.

[Illustration: TOM RIDING ON A BUTTERFLY.]

Tom remained at home for some time; but at last getting weary of his
humble life, he watched for an opportunity to reach king Arthur’s court
again. One day he sauntered out into the fields, and seeing a butterfly
seated on the ground, he ventured to get astride of him. The butterfly
soon took wing, and mounting into the air with Tom on his back, flew
from field to field, till at last he reached the king’s court.

The king, queen, and nobles, all tried to catch the butterfly, but
could not. At last poor Tom, having no saddle or bridle, slipped off
and tumbled into a watering-pot, where he was nearly drowned before he
could be taken out. But he soon recovered from this mishap, and once
more became the pride and ornament of king Arthur’s court.

At last, a huge spider one day attacked him, and though he drew his
sword and fought well, yet the spider’s poisonous breath at last
overcame him.

King Arthur and his whole court went into mourning for little Tom
Thumb. They buried him under a rose-bush, and raised a white marble
monument over his grave, with this epitaph on it, in letters of gold:

  Here lies Tom Thumb, a gallant knight,
  Who died by a cruel spider’s bite.
  He was well known in king Arthur’s court,
  Where he afforded pleasant sport;
  He rode at tilt and tournament,
  And on a mouse a hunting went.
  Alive, he filled the court with mirth;
  His death to general grief gave birth.
  Good people, tears of sorrow shed,
  And cry, Alas! Sir Tom is dead!

Now, my little readers, which do you like best,--_true stories_,
_moral_ and _instructive_ stories, or stories like the wonderful
adventures of


TOM THUMB?

  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.

  The words _pedler_ and _pedlar_ both appear in the original.
  Research has revealed that both spellings were in use at the time of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
