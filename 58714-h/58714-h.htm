TOM THUMB.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>When I was a little boy, children&#8217;s
books were not quite as plenty, or as
cheap, or as <i>good</i> as they are now.
In those days, children did not often
have a present of a pretty book with
beautiful pictures; but when they
did get one, it was highly prized.</p>

<p>We had Cock Robin, and Jack the
Giant Killer, and Blue Beard, and
The Forty Thieves, and many other
<i>amusing</i> but not very <i>instructive</i> tales.
Tom Thumb was one of the number,
and was a favorite book of mine, although
I knew the story was not true,
and that there were no such beings as
magicians and fairies. Perhaps my
little readers would like to know
what kind of stories we old folks read
when we were such little bodies as
you are now. I think I remember
enough of Tom Thumb to be able to
tell you the story.</p>

<p class="caption">MERLIN AND THE FAIRY QUEEN.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Once on a time, Merlin, a famous
magician, was traveling, and being
weary, he stopped at a plowman&#8217;s
cottage to ask for some refreshment.
The plowman&#8217;s wife kindly brought
him a bowl of milk, and a wooden
plate of good brown bread, which she
urged him to partake of.</p>

<p>Merlin could not help seeing, that
the honest couple looked quite sad
and sorrowful; so he asked the cause,
and learned that they had no children;
the wife declaring, with tears
in her eyes, that she should be happy
if she had a son, even if he were no
bigger than his father&#8217;s thumb!</p>

<p>Merlin was much amused with the
idea of a boy no bigger than a man&#8217;s
thumb, and sending for the queen of
the fairies, he told her of the desire
of the plowman&#8217;s wife. The queen
was no less pleased than Merlin, and
she said the wish should be granted.
Accordingly, the plowman&#8217;s wife
had a son, who was just the size of
his father&#8217;s thumb, and was named
by the queen, <span class="smcap">Tom Thumb</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PEDLER AND THE PUDDING.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>One day his mother was making a
pudding, and that he might see how
it was made, Tom climbed on the top
of the bowl; but his foot happening
to slip, he fell over head and ears into
it, and his mother not seeing him,
she stirred him into the batter, and
then popped the whole into the pot.</p>

<p>The hot water made Tom kick
and struggle, and his mother, seeing
the pudding jump up and down in
the pot, thought it was bewitched.
A pedlar going by at that moment,
she gave him the pudding, which he
put in his pack and then walked on.
As soon as Tom could get the batter
out of his mouth, he began to cry out.
This so frightened the pedler that he
flung the pudding over a fence, and
took to his heels. The pudding was
broken by the fall, and poor Tom
crawled out and ran home.</p>

<p class="caption">TOM LANDS IN THE HOT SOUP.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Tom never was any bigger; but as
he grew older he grew cunning and
sly. When he played with boys for
cherry-stones, and had lost his own,
he used to creep into his playmates&#8217;
bags, fill his pockets, and come out to
play again. One day, as he was doing
this, the owner chanced to see him.
&#8220;Ah, ha, my little Tom,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
have caught you at last; now I will
punish you for stealing.&#8221; So he drew
the bag-string tight about his neck,
and then shaking the bag, Tom&#8217;s legs
and thighs were so sadly bruised, that
he was thrown into a raging fever.</p>

<p>Just at this time the queen of the
fairies came in a coach drawn by six
flying mice, and placing Tom by her
side, drove through the air to her palace
in fairy land, where she kept him
till he was restored to health. Then,
taking advantage of a fair wind, she
blew him straight to the court of king
Arthur. But just as Tom was about
to land in the palace-yard, the king&#8217;s
cook happened to pass with a huge
bowl of soup, into which Tom fell
plump, and splashed the hot soup all
in the cook&#8217;s face and eyes.</p>

<p class="caption">TOM SWALLOWED BY A FISH.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221; cried Tom,
half scalded and half drowned in his
hot bath; &#8220;murder! murder! murder!&#8221;
bellowed the cook, who was a
cross, red-faced old fellow, and supposed
Tom had done all this mischief
on purpose. Determined to be revenged
on the little fellow for the imaginary
insult, he urged his brother,
who was a miller, and as cross and
cruel as himself, to take little Tom
home with him, and put him where
he could do no more mischief.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the miller pocketed
Tom, and carrying him to his mill,
dropped him from a window into the
river. But Tom was not born to be
drowned. A large salmon swimming
by at that moment, caught him
in its mouth and swallowed him
without any trouble.</p>

<p class="caption">TOM RELEASED.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>The salmon was soon caught, and
being a fine large fish, was presented
to the king, who ordered it to be
dressed immediately. When it was
cut open, every body was delighted
to see little Tom Thumb step out.
He soon became the favorite of the
king, who knighted him, and gave
him a little golden palace to live in,
and also a tiny coach, which was
drawn by six white mice.</p>

<p>King Arthur one day questioned
Tom about his parents, and Tom informed
his majesty that they were
worthy people, but very poor. Then
the king led him into his treasury,
and showing him the piles of gold
and silver, told him he might pay his
parents a visit, and take with him
as much money as he could carry!
Accordingly, Tom procured a little
purse, and putting a sixpence into
it, he with much labor and difficulty
got the purse upon his back and
started for home.</p>

<p>His mother met him at the door,
where he arrived almost tired to
death, having traveled nearly half a
mile, with a huge sixpence on his
back. His parents were delighted
to see him, especially as he brought
such an amazing sum of money.</p>

<p class="caption">TOM RIDING ON A BUTTERFLY.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Tom remained at home for some
time; but at last getting weary of
his humble life, he watched for an
opportunity to reach king Arthur&#8217;s
court again. One day he sauntered
out into the fields, and seeing a butterfly
seated on the ground, he ventured
to get astride of him. The
butterfly soon took wing, and mounting
into the air with Tom on his
back, flew from field to field, till at
last he reached the king&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>The king, queen, and nobles, all
tried to catch the butterfly, but could
not. At last poor Tom, having no
saddle or bridle, slipped off and tumbled
into a watering-pot, where he
was nearly drowned before he could
be taken out. But he soon recovered
from this mishap, and once more
became the pride and ornament of
king Arthur&#8217;s court.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>At last, a huge spider one day
attacked him, and though he drew his
sword and fought well, yet the spider&#8217;s
poisonous breath at last overcame
him.</p>

<p>King Arthur and his whole court
went into mourning for little Tom
Thumb. They buried him under a
rose-bush, and raised a white marble
monument over his grave, with this
epitaph on it, in letters of gold:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Here lies Tom Thumb, a gallant knight,</div>
<div class="verse">Who died by a cruel spider&#8217;s bite.</div>
<div class="verse">He was well known in king Arthur&#8217;s court,</div>
<div class="verse">Where he afforded pleasant sport;</div>
<div class="verse">He rode at tilt and tournament,</div>
<div class="verse">And on a mouse a hunting went.</div>
<div class="verse">Alive, he filled the court with mirth;</div>
<div class="verse">His death to general grief gave birth.</div>
<div class="verse">Good people, tears of sorrow shed,</div>
<div class="verse">And cry, Alas! Sir Tom is dead!</div>
